### Hi there! I'm Francis Kodama! ðŸ‘‹

## WELCOME TO MY SPACE INVADERS PROJECT. ðŸ‘¾

# this.Project ðŸ“–

It's pretty awesome to build classic video games. You learn to play!

## Why?

As I studied product management, agile, and some other things, I have not been coding for some time. I want to make my big return with a fun project to allow me to catch up with the syntax.
</br>
</br>

## How?

That's why I decided to build this project. This tutorial again from Ania Kubow (mentioned on the Pac Man project) uses a great deal of Vanilla Javascript logic. Therefore, it was a good place to restart.
</br>
</br>

## What?

As I did with Pac Man, I challenged myself to create new buttons and redesign the entire video game.
</br>
</br>

## Compare with original: Ania KubÃ³w's Tutorial

By the way, thanks, Ania! Your videos are awesome. You helped me a lot in my coding journey!
